## Training data
- 100 aerial images acquired from GoogleMaps
- Ground truth: image with 0=bg, 1=road

## Evaluation
- prediction accuracy, measured by fraction of correctly predicted patches

## Hand in
- novel solution by combining and extending previous work.
- compare your novel solution to at least two baseline algorithms.
- methodology and experimental results in the form of a short scientific paper. (max 4 pages)
